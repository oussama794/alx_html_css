## üé® CSS Methodologies

### BEM Naming Convention
Classes follow the Block-Element-Modifier methodology for maintainable CSS:
```css
.header__navigation
.button--primary
.card__title--large
```

### Mobile-First Approach
Base styles target mobile devices, with desktop enhancements added via media queries:
```css
/* Mobile-first base styles */
.container {
    padding: 1rem;
}

/* Desktop enhancements */
@media (min-width: 481px) {
    .container {
        padding: 2rem 0;
        max-width: 1000px;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
}
```
